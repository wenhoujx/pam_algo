this is an implementation of PAM K-medoids algorithm based on the wiki papge.

Rewrite the total_cost() function with scipy.spatial.distance.cdist() fucntion, which is way faster than the stupid loop I wrote. 
before changing, 30s to run N = 50
after changing, 23s for N = 50

change the function in clustering(), now everything is super fast. I can even train on N = 1000

add the kmeans code using the scikit-learn toolbox. The result is good, runs fast, easy to scale. It seems they don't have the k-medoids() functions built-in.
